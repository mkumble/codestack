EthnicityCuisineCorrelator: The project tries to analyze the impact of ethnicity on cuisine preferences across different counties in the United States. We use the CityGrid API to retrieve the cuisine information across counties and census.gov to retrieve the ethnicity information.

The files provided here are the components that train and test the data.

The group project is under progress. More details of the project:
