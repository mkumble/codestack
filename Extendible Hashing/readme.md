 
Extendible Hashing - Extendible hashing is a datastructure suitable for efficient storage of data. The project demonstrates the advantages of extendible hashing over static hashing for a huge amount of student records. The project also demonstrates the performance issues associated with directory collapse and directory doubling. 

A bucket (a block of data that is read/written) contains fixed number of records. The project currently stores 4 student records in the bucket. The directories index the bucket using a binary code generated from the hash function.
